# learn-to-code-java
A learn-to-code game that teaches programming in Java.

[![Java CI with Maven](https://github.com/EndicottCollegeCSC/learn-to-code-java/actions/workflows/maven.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/EndicottCollegeCSC/learn-to-code-java/actions/workflows/maven.yml)

## Level One
### Overview
In this level you will lexpolore what you are going to learn in this course and take a look at the final project that you will be working on.



## Level Two
### A Basic Introduction
In this level you will have a basic introduction on how to read a program, The Anatomy of a program, Variables, and Arrays.



## Level Three
### If Statements
In this level you will learn how to use if, else if, and else statements through a number of activites.



## Level Four
### Learning Loops
In this level you will learn what loops are and how to use them through a number of activities. 



## Level Five
### Methods
In this level you will learn how to use and write methods in java through a number of activities. 



## Level Six
### Putting it all Together
In this level you will take everything that you have learned so far and apply it to the final programming project that you are going to be working on. 
Keep in mind that all the mthods that you write for this project will be used again in the end for the final project. 



## Level Seven
### Classes Pt.1
In this level you will have an introduction to class and how they work. You will get an overview of what classes are, how they are used, and the anatomy of a class. 



## Level Eight
### Classes Pt.2
In this level you will get familiar with writing a class. You will have activites throughout the level that will teach you about how to write a class, different types of methods in a class, and constructors. 



## Level Nine
### Classes Pt.3
In this level you will learn about parent child classes, how to use classes that you have written, and differnt types of classes. 



## Level Ten
### Final Project
In the final level you will take everything that you have learned so far and apply it to a final project. You will be using the same methods that you wrote in the mid way project as well as writing some new ones using the new material you have learned. 



## Game Directory Structure
Each level and activity can be modified via the config folder in ```src/main/resources```. 

Each ```manifest.json``` file tells the Java program the metadata (name) and what folders/files to go to and load.

Both ```intro.txt``` and ```outro.txt``` display text when starting/ending a section.

```description.txt``` tells the user the step by step process when writing code.

```TestHarness.java``` is code where the user's code snippet will be inserted into. Then the program runs it to see if the test passes.

```
/config
	manifest.json
	intro.txt
	outro.txt
	/level1
		manifest.json
                intro.txt
                outro.txt
		/activity1
			manifest.json
                        description.txt
			TestHarness.java
		/activity2
			...
		...
	/level2
		...	
	...
```



# How to Run
I will let you know when I figure that out... Good Luck.
